## Accessibility Statement

Heart of Clojure is an inclusive conference and as such strives to be accessible to everyone. This includes:

- Ensuring our venues are accessible by wheelchair.
- Making sure that maps and orientation material is available.
- Providing clear signage to, from and through the building.
- Providing complimentary tickets for assistants for disabled participants.
- Serving a wide range of food and special requests.
- Sadly, only guide animals are allowed at the venue.

Our goal is that the conference and all other related events are accessible to
disabled people. However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and
we may not have everything covered off in our plans - please reach out, and we
will do our very best to confirm we have those requirements under control. Send
a mail to [orga@heartofclojure.eu](mailto:orga@heartofclojure.eu).

We will happily reserve you a ticket if itâ€™s not immediately clear whether
necessary assistance is provided or you have additional planning to do for your
trip to Heart of Clojure.
