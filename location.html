      Leuven is a university city with a rich past and plenty of hospitality to offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The historic center is largely <strong class="pink-t60">car-free</strong> and easily
      navigated on foot, making it a visitor friendly destination. With hundreds of years of
      history, <strong class="pink-t60">many local breweries</strong> and a small walkable core,
      it's a perfect playground for the community to mingle.
